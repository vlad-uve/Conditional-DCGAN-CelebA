# **‚öôÔ∏è Tech Deep Dive**

# üìä 1. Evaluation - How good is the model?

The evaluation demonstrates that the model is **both quantitatively strong (FID ‚âà 4.8)** and **qualitatively reliable (attribute control is clear and consistent)**. Together, these results confirm that the model is not just producing visually appealing faces but is a **well-tuned conditional GAN** that balances realism, diversity, and controllability.


## üìà 1.1. FID metric
Frechet Inception Distance (FID) measures how closely generated images match real data. It compares **feature statistics** (means and covariances) of real vs. generated images, extracted from a pre-trained **Inception-V3** model (standard in GAN evaluation).  
**Lower FID ‚Üí more realistic and diverse images.**

### 1.1.1. Evaluation protocol:
- **Dataset:** CelebA, 64√ó64 resolution 
- **Data split:** 10k validation samples for tuning, 10k held-out for final evaluation 
- **Generator:** EMA generator (smoothed weights for stable outputs)  
- **Generated samples:** 10k generated faces to match real set  
- **Preprocessing:** map outputs from **[-1,1] ‚Üí [0,1]** 
- **Backbone:** Inception-V3 pool features from `torcheval.metrics.FrechetInceptionDistance`


### 1.1.2. FID progression over training:
- In early epochs, **FID** dropped quickly into the **~10 range**.  
- Improvements slowed after that, with clear **plateaus** where both **visual quality** and **FID** stopped changing. Runs were concluded at these points if further attempts to break the plateau failed.  
- The best of **Experiment 3** reached **FID ‚âà 7.8**
- **FID** entered the range **around 5** only after significant **architecture + optimization** changes during **Experiments 5-8**
- **Final model** from **Experiment 8** demonstrated **FID ‚âà 4.8**

  <img src="images/charts/FID_pogression_epochs_15_45.png" width="400"/>
</p>

### 1.1.3. Final Result:
The model achieves **testing FID ‚âà 4.8**, confirming strong alignment with real data and visible improvements in realism and diversity.


## 1.2. üé≠ Attribute Control
To evaluate **atribute control**, generated images were compared against real samples for all **4 attribute combinations** in the Table below.

- **Male attribute**:  
  - Male=1 ‚Üí consistent masculine facial structures, minimal leakage.  
  - Male=0 ‚Üí feminine faces with appropriate styling.  
- **Smiling attribute**:  
  - Smiling=1 ‚Üí clear smiles, natural teeth.  
  - Smiling=0 ‚Üí neutral/closed-mouth expressions; occasional distortions, but rare.  


**Fake vs Real Examples**  

| Attribute combo            | Generated (fake)                                         | Real                                             |
|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| male=1, smiling=1           | <img src="images/grid_images/16_fake_images_male=1_smiling=1.png" width="300"/> | <img src="images/grid_images/16_real_images_male=1_smiling=1.png" width="300"/> |
| male=1, smiling=0           | <img src="images/grid_images/16_fake_images_male=1_smiling=0.png" width="300"/> | <img src="images/grid_images/16_real_images_male=1_smiling=0.png" width="300"/> |
| male=0, smiling=1           | <img src="images/grid_images/16_fake_images_male=0_smiling=1.png" width="300"/> | <img src="images/grid_images/16_real_images_male=0_smiling=1.png" width="300"/> |
| male=0, smiling=0           | <img src="images/grid_images/16_fake_images_male=0_smiling=0.png" width="300"/> | <img src="images/grid_images/16_real_images_male=0_smiling=0.png" width="300"/> |

> **Summary:** Generated images match real examples relatively closely. Both Male and Smiling attributes demonstrate **clean, reliable control** across all combinations. Remaining mismatches stem mainly from borderline cases (ambiguous hairstyles, subtle expressions) rather than systemic failure.

# 2. üèóÔ∏è Model Design - Why does the model work?

The final model emerged through **iterative modifications** of the classical DCGAN architecture based on experiment outcomes.

## üñºÔ∏è 2.1. Resolution
We trained at **64√ó64** resolution to balance stability, fidelity, and efficiency:
- 64x64 **preserves key facial features** while avoiding severe distortion compared to 32√ó32.  
- 64√ó64 **trains significantly faster** than 128√ó128, enabling larger batch sizes and faster iteration/debugging.  
 - once stable at 64√ó64, the same architecture can be **scaled to 128√ó128** for higher fidelity

>**Why it matters:** enabled fast prototyping while still producing realistic, attribute-controlled faces.  

## üß¨ 2.2. Generator
The final generator is a **deep convolutional network with attribute conditioning** (see Figure below).  

- **Input:** G takes two inputs: a 100-dimensional latent vector *z* and a 2- dimensional binary attribute vector *c*. These are concatenated in a single vector.

- **Input fusion:** The vector *[z,c]* goes through a **fully connected layer** and **reshaping**. It fuses the vector input into **seed 736x4x4 feature map** as a starting, learnable canvas.

- **Upsampling pathway:**  a stack of upsampling convolutional blocks **(ConvTranspose ‚Üí BatchNorm ‚Üí ReLU)**.  progessively doubles the spatial resolution while reducing channel depth, gradually building facial structure and texture.

- **Output layer:** A final convolution maps to 3 channels, and a **Tanh** activation squashes pixel values into [-1, 1]. The output *G(z,c)* is **3x64x64 images in [-1, +1] interval**.
 

## 2.3. üîç Discriminator
The final architecture of the discriminator is a **deep convolutional discriminator with projection conditioning** (see the Figure below). 

- **Image pathway:** D passes an input tensor *x* (3x64x64 image) through a sequence of convolutional downsampling blocks **(Conv2d ‚Üí LeakyReLU, with Spectral Normalization, no BatchNorm)**. Each block halves spatial resolution and increases channels. A global **sum pooling** produces the final 512-dimensional feature vector *f(x)*.

- **Unconditional score:** An unconditional score *h(f(x))* (how realistic the image looks regardless of attributes) is computed by passing the pooled feature vector *(f(x)* through a **linear layer** that maps it to a single scalar.

- **Attributes pathway:** The attribute vector *c* is mapped with a **linear layer** to a 512-dim embedding *e(c)*, matching the image feature vector.

- **Projection step:** A final real-value score (logit) is computed as *D(x,c) = h(f(x)) + f(x)T * e(c)*

> **Why Projection-D:**  emperically, it  improved stability and lower FID, compared to a classical conditional D that concatenates attributes to the image channels.

</p>


> üëâ **Note:** The number of convolutional features was varied as a hyperparameter to achieve better balance between D's and G's default capabilities 

# ‚öñÔ∏è 3. Training, Monitoring, Optimization - How to keep the model stable?

Stabilizing adversarial dynamics required a **toolkit of monitoring signals, adaptive regularization, and carefully chosen loss functions**. These methods ensured that the discriminator (D) and generator (G) remained in equilibrium, avoiding collapse while steadily improving image quality.

## üß™ 3.1. Monitoring the Balance Indicators
To track this equilibrium, we monitored:


  - **D real accuracy**: fraction of real images correctly classified. Healthy range: ~0.6‚Äì0.8 was kept. 
  - **G fooling rate**: fraction of generated images classified as real. Healthy range: ~0.2‚Äì0.3.  

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/charts/d_real_acc_and_g_fool_rate_ema.png" width="80%">
</p>

- **E[D(real)] vs E[D(fake)] (ED delta)**: the logit gap between real and fake batches. A stable training run should show a consistent positive gap that narrows slowly as G improves.  

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/charts/delta_ED_ema.png" width="85%">
</p>

- **Gradient norms**: detect exploding/vanishing updates.  

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/charts/g_grad_norms.png" width="80%">
</p>

- **Relative weight updates ratio**:  confirms models keep updating and learning.  

<p align="center">
  <img src="images\charts\g_rel_weight_change.png" width="80%">
</p>

- **Visual samples from EMA generator**: sanity check for mode collapse and image realism.  


>**Summary.** The figures indicate a stable Discriminator-Generator equilibrium and consistent improvement of G over time.


## üõ† 3.2 Regularization Toolkit
Adaptive tools applied during training:

- **R1 gradient penalty (gamma, k):** applied on real batches; increase when D overfits, relax when underfitting.
- **Spectral Normalization (D):** default on all layers to stabilize gradients.
- **DiffAugment** (color, translation, cutout, noise, flip): light policies always on to prevent D memorization; enable/strengthen policies adaptively when D shows overfitting signals.   
- **Gradient clipping:** prevent overflows in fp16; relaxed when learning slowed 
- **Label smoothing:** real labels set to 0.9 to avoid over-confident discriminator  


## üîÑ 3.3. Training-Loop Controls
- **Update ratio (D:G):** baseline 1:1; temporarily 2:1 if G too strong, 1:2 if D too strong  
- **Adjustable learning rates:** dynamic resets favored one side when imbalance appeared  

## ‚ûó 3.4. Loss function
We adopted **hinge loss** from Experiment 5 onward, replacing binary cross-entropy:

**Formulas**

*Loss_D = E[relu(1-D(x,c))] + E[relu(1+D(G(z,c),c))]*

*Loss_G = -E[D(G(z,c),c))]*

**Why hinge loss?**
- Healthier training dynamics  
- Better balance between D and G  
- Steadier gradients for G  
- More realistic images  
- Robust under mixed precision (fp16)  


### üìâ 3.3.1 Loss diagram

The figures below for the **actual losses** and the **EMA-smoothed losses** indicate the **healthy adversarial equilibrium**. While raw D and G losses oscillate within bounded ranges (as expected in GANs), the window gradually narrows. The EMA D and G losses plateaus smoothly, confirming that the **dynamics stabilize**.

# üìà 4. Experiment Log (8 runs)

This log documents eight experiments, showing both successful strategies and failed attempts that informed the final design

## üß™ 4.1. Experiment 1

* **Setup:** Generic DCGAN architecture; 40 CelebA attributes; BCE loss; cosine learning rate with warm up and decay
* **Resulted images:** Unrealistic, blurred faces; implausible attribute combinations
* **Conclusion:** Too many (and correlated) attributes confounded learning; attribute set was imbalanced and unrealistic

üëâ *Key Takeaway:* Simplify conditioning before tuning architecture.

## üß™ 4.2. Experiment 2

* **Setup:** 6 lightly correlated attributes ("No_Beard", "Young", "Attractive", "Male", "Smiling", "Wavy_Hair")
* **Key changes:** Reduced attribute set to narrow conditioning
- **Resulted images:** Checkerboard patterns; many identical-looking images
- **Training dynamics observations:** Early mode collapse
- **Conclusion:** D was too strong; regularization needed to prevent collapse


üëâ *Key Takeaway:* Regularization required to keep D in check.

## üß™ 4.3. Experiment 3
- **Setup:** Added R1, Spectral Norm, label smoothing; D to G steps ratio
- **Key changes:** Regularization to stabilize training dynamics 
- **Resulted images:** Crisper, more diverse faces; some samples are flawed; FID ‚âà 7.5  
- **Training dynamics observations:** training reached a plateau
- **Conclusion:** Robust for the scope, but headroom limited; needed betters means to monitor training dynamics to improve further

üëâ *Key Takeaway:* Monitoring needed; G still too weak.

## üß™ 4.4. Experiment 4
- **Setup:** Added EMA generator, additional training logs/monitoring, and augmenter
- **Key changes:** Use averaged model for inference; expand monitoring and training logs 
- **Resulted images:** No clear visual improvement over Exp 3  
- **Training dynamics observations:** Marginal gains; D continued to overpower G; G fooling rate fluctuates around 0  
- **Conclusion:** EMA improves fidelity slightly, but D architecture remained too catchy; balance was fragile

üëâ *Key Takeaway:* Need architectural fix, not just monitoring.

## üß™ 4.5. Experiment 5
- **Setup:** Projection Discriminator; 2 uncorrelated attributes ("Smiling", "Male"); hinge loss; remove BatchNorm from D  
- **Key changes:** Reworked D to projection-style to suit conditional learning and give G more room to keep up with D; simplify the attrbutes space
- **Resulted images:** Slightly blurred but more diverse faces 
- **Training dynamics observations:** Plateau observed; G still comparatively weak; Cosine LR stalled G; G too fragile; grad/weight-update monitoring highlighted the imbalance  
- **Conclusion:** G needed more capacity/resilience; constant LR preferred over late-stage cosine for continued progress.

üëâ *Key Takeaway:* G needs capacity + constant LR.

## üß™ 4.6. Experiment 6
- **Setup:** Constant learning rates with manual (instant/gradual) LR changes; increased number of convolutional filters in G
- **Key changes:** Reinforced G; manual control of LR
- **Resulted images:** Crisp, diverse faces with fewer artifacts; FID ~ 5.5  
- **Training dynamics observations:** no plateau yet, but marginal improvement resumed; training was in equilibrium but D loses a little  
- **Conclusion:** A solid baseline achieved; manual augmentation of D capacity required for further improvement

üëâ *Key Takeaway:* Reinforcing G + constant LR works well.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è 4.7. Experiment 7
- **Setup:** Added minibatch-stddev layer to D mid-training; enable gradient clamping  
- **Key changes:** Mid-training ‚Äúsurgery‚Äù on D
- **Resulted images:** Loss of fidelity and quality  
- **Training dynamics observations:** Training collapse/NaNs.  
- **Conclusion:** Model state was not suitable for architecture changes; D gradients were huge; LR too high for safe mid-training surgery; needed LR anneal, stronger gradient monitoring/clamping

üëâ *Key Takeaway:* Architecture changes need lower LR + stronger monitoring.

## üèÜ 4.8. Experiment 8 (Final)
- **Setup:** Rollback to Exp 5; train +10 extra epochs with calmer LRs and grad clamps
- **Key changes:** Healed and stabilized D 
- **Resulted images:** Consistent quality with Exp 6; FID ~ 4.8
- **Training dynamics observations:** Healthy and balanced training process under less extreme regularization and learning schedule than Exp 5
- **Conclusion:** Ready model for deployment; strong foundation for a future architecture augmentations

üëâ *Key Takeaway:* Careful LR control and stability tricks ‚Üí best results.
